# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: An if, else if, or else statement that uses the boolean primitive data type to check whether something is true or false.

Researched answer: Conditional statements allow us to write code that performs different actions, based on different decisions. the 'If' statement is the most fundamental statement that is checked first, and if it false, it will move on to the next code. If there is any 'if else' statements, they will be checked if true or false next. If all is false, any 'else' statements will trigger.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a software that controls versions, and Github is a cloud website used by developers to store and share code back and forth in order to work together on a single project.

Researched answer: Git is a software that is ran on each local machine. It is also used to store and trade code between developers, but each computer needs the software installed. Github is a cloud, web-base git repository. Github can be used by anyoneany developers connected to the internet. 

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: =, <, >, <=, >=, ==, ===

Researched answer: I put '=' as an answer, but after researching, I realize that '=' actually assigns a value and does not check whether a value is true or false. I also forgot the '!=' which is an assignment operator that checks if something is NOT equal to something else. The difference between the '==' and '===' operators, is that '==' converts different data types to the same type and checks if the values are the same, while '===' checks the value AND the data type.

1. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: An array's index is the numerical place value, where it sits in the array, starting from 0. For example, if an array has 4 different elements, they're index values starting from the left would be 0, 1, 2, 3. The value is the actual element in that place. For example, if the 2nd element (index 1), was the string "cupcakes", then the value is "cupcakes".

Researched answer: Arrays are a data type, but not a primitive data type. They can however, contain any mix of the primitive data types, essentially grouping them together in an easy to access array. Also to note, some built in methods are mutators, and when used with an array, will output something different than what is expected (at least for a beginner coder). For example, if .push is used on the array to add something to the array, it will instead output the number of elements in the array (plus the new pushed one).

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Arrays are a data type that can contain multiple data types. I'm guessing they can even contain other arrays, which I will verify in the researched answer. Arrays use the [brackets] to contain the different data types, which are seperated by commas. A string is a set of characters, which are held insdie "quotation marks". They are both containers in that sense, however, There is only one string within the quotation marks, while an array can hold multiple elements inside one set of brackets. 

Researched answer: Arrays can hold multiple data types, including other arrays. Even though an array can hold multiple elements, it is still considered a single variable. A string on the other hand, may be a set of characters, but is considered one variable and one element.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: The driver is the person writing the code. The navigator is the person guiding the driver towards the shared goal. The navigator makes it easier for the driver to focus on the current code block by also keeping track of the end goal, or at least the bigger picture. It is both programmers responsibility to work together through blockers. Writing code is also a very detail oriented task, therefore, having another set of eyes on the same project helps immensely in catching small mistakes, that could potentially keep a whole code from working as intended. Pair programming is also an effective way to keep accountability. After a certain amount of time or work, the driver and navigator may switch, which also relieves one another in becoming too monotonous.

Researched answer: According to most google definitions, pair programming is actually a pair of people on ONE work station. However, for us, it applies to two people on two different local workstations, sharing and working on the same code, by using a sharing service called github. Pair programming uses the 4 eyes principle, ensuring that there is always two sets of eyes on the same code. Benefits include, increased resiliency, less mistakes, and in our case, two people of approximately equal skill, can possibly help work through each others personal blockers. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: From what I understand, a function is an input and output that are related to each other, and a higher order function, is a function that uses another function, or outputs another function. 

2. Jest: Jest seems like a software used to test any code for mistakes, errors, or unwanted side effects.

3. Objects: An object is the keyword used to store functional data. It's like giving a name to a set of instructions.

4. Method: A method is the instruction that is attached to an object.

5. Classes: A class is a template for objects.
